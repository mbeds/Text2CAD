# Text2CAD  
**Experimental Python Project**  

Text2CAD is an innovative experimental Python script that generates 3D models based on natural language prompts. While it’s functional, further refinement and a dedicated CAD model integration could significantly improve its capabilities.

---

## 🛠️ **Requirements**  
To run Text2CAD, you’ll need:  
1. **Ollama** installed locally.  
   - **Model**: `llama3.2` (recommended, but you can experiment with other models).  
2. **Python** (latest stable version recommended).  
3. Output format support:  
   - **STL** or **SCAD** (recommended).  

This project works particularly well with **OpenSCAD (SCAD)** for 3D model outputs.  

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**  
1. **Input a Prompt**: Describe the 3D model you want to generate.  
2. **Generate a 3D Model**: The script interprets the prompt and creates a corresponding model.  
3. **Output the Model**: Export the generated design to **STL** or **SCAD** format for further editing or printing.

## 🔄 **Future Plans**  
- **Neo4j Integration**:  
   - Connect to a Neo4j database.  
   - Pull 10 similar CAD designs based on the input prompt.  
   - Use the retrieved data to generate a custom design based on the provided specifications.  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Database**: Enhance the customization and relevance of generated designs by leveraging a RAG database.  

---

## ✨ **How to Improve**  
- Modify the prompts to fine-tune the output.  
- Experiment with different models or enhance the parsing logic.  
- Expand functionality to include other CAD formats and advanced specifications.
